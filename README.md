# Accelerometer-analysis-ESP32-LABWindows-cvi
>Data analysis recieved from accelerometer - adxl345, microcontroller- ESP32, GUI - LABWindows cvi

## Project description 

Samples taken from adxl345 accelerometer with I2C communication to the ESP32 microcontroller, then in UART the data is Delivered to the CVI program.
The GUI created shows the acceleration in x,y and z axis. Further analysis was performed to check if a free fall had been detected.
The samples can be saved in Excel file.
Additional panel preform tow tasks (display random dots on a canvas, display fibonacci shapes on a canvas) simultaneously (thread pool).
